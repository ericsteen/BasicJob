= BasicJob - Concept Version

A proof of concept in progress -- this gem will be generalized to handle a vast array of jobs within a rails app, and is inspired by this GoRuCo talk by 'Aunt' Sandi(http://confreaks.net/videos/240-goruco2009-solid-object-oriented-design).

It may evolve to Rails::Engine status in the near future, stay tuned and feel free to join as a committer. Just make a pull request.

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
