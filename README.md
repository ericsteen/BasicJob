# BasicJob - Concept Version

A work in progress -- this gem is intended to be developed into a full-fledged web-scraping and
downloading utility for easing the creation of iOS apps and is inspired by this GoRuCo talk by 'Aunt' Sandi:

It may evolve to Rails::Engine status in the near future, stay tuned and feel free to join as a committer. Just make a pull request.

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
